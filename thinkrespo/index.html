            <p>You have to commit yourself to all that you do. No excuses and no zero day if you really want it. You
                have to constantly show up. You'll don't know the power of consistency. </p>

            <p>To be good at it needs some good amount of time familiarizing yourself with the ins and outs of your
                craft. Rome was never built in one day. have hope, be bold, show up and take the chance.</p>
