This is a small stylesheet that
helps even out discrepancies among the user agent stylesheets of various
browsers. You can download it from https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/.
Add this before your stylesheet as part of your base styles.

 So far, you’ve created a Message, a Media, a Dropdown, and a Menu module. Some
other examples of good module names include panel, alert, collapsible-section, and
form-control.
