 Because you’re opening the pattern library files directly from disc, you may notice
the Overview link in the table of contents still doesn’t work. This is because KSS links
it to the url ./ rather than to index.html. To make this work, you’ll need to serve the
pattern library via an HTTP server so the ./ url will resolve to index.html in the
browser. I’ll leave this for you to do, depending on the toolset you’re most familiar
with. If you’re unsure where to start, try the npm package http-server (https://www
.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
