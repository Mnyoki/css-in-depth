min-width and max-width are the most common ones you’ll use by far. But you
can also use a number of other types of media features. Here’s some examples:

 (min-height: 20em)—Targets viewports 20 em and taller

 (max-height: 20em)—Targets viewports 20 em and shorter

 (orientation: landscape)—Targets viewports that are wider than they are tall

 (orientation: portrait)—Targets viewports that are taller than they are wide

 (min-resolution: 2dppx)—Targets devices with a screen resolution of 2 dots
per pixel or higher; targets retina displays

 (max-resolution: 2dppx)—Targets devices with a screen resolution of up to 2
dots per pixel
