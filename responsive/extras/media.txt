min-width and max-width are the most common ones you’ll use by far. But you
can also use a number of other types of media features. Here’s some examples:

 (min-height: 20em)—Targets viewports 20 em and taller

 (max-height: 20em)—Targets viewports 20 em and shorter

 (orientation: landscape)—Targets viewports that are wider than they are tall

 (orientation: portrait)—Targets viewports that are taller than they are wide

 (min-resolution: 2dppx)—Targets devices with a screen resolution of 2 dots
per pixel or higher; targets retina displays

 (max-resolution: 2dppx)—Targets devices with a screen resolution of up to 2
dots per pixel

 Web designer Brad Frost has compiled a list of responsive patterns that you can

nb//
 Sometimes, you won’t even need the media queries, as natural line wrapping will
take care of that for you. Flexbox layouts using flex-wrap: wrap and a reasonable
flex-basis is an excellent way to do this. Similarly, a grid layout with auto-fit or
auto-fill grid columns will determine how many items will fit in a row before wrap￾ping to a new one. You could also use inline-block elements, though in that case, they
won’t grow to fill the width of the container.

 Use the Save for web
option in your image editor, which will greatly reduce the image’s file size, or use
another image compression tool such as https://tinypng.com/
