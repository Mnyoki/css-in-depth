        <div class="thanks">Much gratitude to the Zlib fraternity for the help they have given with access to free ebooks. The ferderal goverment should let the site do what it does best. Not everyone is able to afford a standard education but everyone i believe under normal circumstances, everyone can download an ebook.
            <p>I haven't followed their story that much but information should be free, not some of it. We also need equal oppotunities and men what century are we in?</p>
