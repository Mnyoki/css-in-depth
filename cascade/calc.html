                pain and come out the same person.

                    We all know what we aught to do but... <br> Man is a very funny creature. We tend to avoid pain as
                    quick as possible, undermining our manlyhood. The generations are being fucked up with lots of toxic
                    feminine energy. Man is no man anymore and women tend to play the no limit solders.

                        Man needs to dignifie himself as man. Since the society is in favor of women, man has been left
                        to fight on his own. <br> The problem is due to the constant stress opossed to men, they became
                        weak with high voices (cowards). <br>
                        How do you expect a coward to fight for himself? no even some signs of retaliation.<br>
